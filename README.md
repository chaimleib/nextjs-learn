Going through the [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) tutorial.

I'm not following the tutorial exactly:

* I'm using Tailwind and PostCSS instead of module CSS
* TypeScript instead of JS
* Added ESLint
* Some React differences, for the sake of learning and experimenting

To run on local:

```sh
npm i
npm run dev
```
